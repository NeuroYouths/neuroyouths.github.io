Ph.D candidates Edith Brignoni-Perez and Shady El Damaty visited the new Kenliworth Recreational Center to talk to aspiring youth basketball stars about the super powers of the teenage brain.

"So, what do you think Michael Jordan was doing on his 13th birthday? Would you say he was partying? I'd be willing to bet he was so busy practicing his jump shot that he missed his own birthday cake!"

Habits will have a much more impactful and long lasting effect on the brains of teenagers than adults or children. What thoughts you stimulate your brain with, the nutrients you put in your body, the physical challenges you approach can transform the life trajectory of a young person.

This secret teenage super-power is exactly what sports legends like Kobe Bryant, Lebron James and Michael Jordan knew about and channeled throughout their youth.
