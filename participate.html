								<h3>Research Aims</h3>
								<p>The aim of our project is to develop materials for assessing the impact of community health on the brain development of teenagers and young adults. These materials could be used to inform and help develop future community programs for drug and violence prevention.</p>
								<p>In order to generate these materials, we need the participation of families with typically developing, healthy youth between ages 12 to 18 years old. </p>
								<h3>What does the study involve?</h3>
								<p>Eligible families are invited to Georgetown Universityâ€™s Medical School to learn more about the study. If both the teen and parent agree to continue, the teenager would answer questionnaires about family life, experiences with violence in the community and attitudes towards drug/alcohol use.</p> 
								<p>A picture of the teen's brain will also be taken using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Participation in the MRI has not been associated with any risks.</p>
								<h3>Compensation</h3>
								<p>You and your child will be compensated for your time after completing the MRI scan and all interviews. Your child will be compensated $40 for completing an MRI scan and interview. The accompanying guardian, will receive $25 each time you visit our study site and complete an interview. All payments will be in the form of a re-loadable gift card.</p>
								<p>The study involves a total of two visits spaced apart by 12 months. The total compensation for completing the study is $80 for the youth and $50 for the parent.</p> 
								<p>Travel to the study site is be provided by default. If you decide to travel on your own, we will refund you $0.50 per mile traveled to and from the study site.</p>
								<h3> Referrals</h3>
								<p>You may also choose to refer other family members or friends into the study. You and the referee will both receive $5 in addition to any other compensation once they complete the study.</p>
